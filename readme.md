# Mtg Life Counter
A simple life counter practicing the things I have learned in react during one of my vacations.

* Click the green zones to increase health
* Click the red zones to decrease health

## Things I learned:
* How to use e.target.id to check if the id is player one or two to incriment the health instead of creating a function for player one and two.
* That empty HTML elements must have a width or height in order to edit it if you do not have any content in the element

## Todo/Improvements
* UI Design
* Cool effects when a player increases or decreases health
